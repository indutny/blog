Over this weekend I got not so original (but definitely a fun one) idea to build
fully distributed and decentralized Twitter. At the time it was inspired by the
[DAT Project][0] and [Hypercore][1], neither of which could support public
replies to user feeds.

Hence, the most natural thing was to [write a new protocol][2]! Say hello to
[HyperBloom][3]!

## Protocol

It is crucial to understand the needs for the protocol before discussing the
protocol itself. Let me list few requirements for it:

* Decentralized and distributed
* Viral. Everyone can reply to anyone's tweet without exchanging any public
  keys or information ahead of time
* Secure

How could it combine all these three qualities into one protocol? By combining
existing solutions, of course:

* [State-based grow-only set][4] with [Bloom Filters][5] for diffs
* Distributed [Public Key Infrastructure][6] (PKI) for append permissions

### Trust Network

Having grow-only set that is writable by anyone on the web is the best way to
introduce enormous amount of spam into social network. This can be tackled by
accepting writes only from your friends. However, this kills the virality of the
platform.

Perhaps friends-of-friends should be allowed to append to that Set? Better!

The way [HyperBloom][3] addresses this is by letting author's issue so called
[*Trust Links*][7]. Each *Trust Link* acts like an edge in the Graph: `A -> B`
or _A_ trusts _B_. When two peers connect to synchronize the values in a Set,
they each present a collection of links from the author of the Set to the peers
themselves. Each successive link in such collection is a continuation of the
previous link: `A -> B, B -> C, C -> D`. With a total limit of **5** links in
one collection (chain).

The limit is imposed to save the bandwidth. To further save it peers help each
other by automatically issuing links that create shorter path to the author.

Example:

1. Peer B has following chain: `A -> B`
2. Peer C has following chain: `A -> D, D -> E, E -> C`
3. Peer B sends `B -> C` to C to minimize the route
4. Peer C uses `A -> B, B -> C` later on

Each link has an expiration time, and such automatic link as in the example will
have the expiration time set to: `minimum(A -> D, D -> E, E -> C)`. Essentially,
`A` always controls how often it wants to refresh its peers' trust.

### Set

Set is not particularly interesting. It borrows some design decisions from
[Bitcoin SPV client][8]. In particular the use of Bloom filters to optimally
compute the difference between the peers and set the missing values.

## Usage

I'm combining both Hypercore and HyperBloom into a project called (for no
particular reason. May be Hyper-uni-corn?) [HyperCorn][9]. HyperCorn uses
HyperCore logs for JSON message fields, and HyperBloom for notifying authors
about replies to their feeds.

HyperBloom Trust Links are stored and distributed through HyperCore. So far it
appears to be working, but it has pretty long way to go still. Mainly it needs
an UI. Contact me, if you are interested!

## Open Questions

* Is virality a good thing?
* Should auto-links be issued?
* Is 5 links enough?

I'd love to hear your opinion.
