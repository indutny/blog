## Bud

To terminate TLS or not? Good question, but instead of answering it - I'll try
to make you believe that if you need a TLS terminator - the [Bud][0] is just
the right choice.

## Other choices

Certainly, there are some other choices for TLS termination like:

* [stud][1]
* [stunnel][2]
* [nginx][3] (though, not only a TLS terminator, but a web server too)
* [haproxy][4] (much more than just a TLS terminator, but quite good!)
* ...probably some others?

However, in many cases [bud][0] could do their job as well as they do and also
provide some unique features.

## Features

### Speed

Bud is as fast as all of it rivals, here are comparison of it to [stud][1]:

Normal response:

{% image "./normal-rps.png", "Normal RPS" %}
{% image "./normal-response.png", "Normal Response" %}

Big response:

{% image "./big-rps.png", "Big RPS" %}
{% image "./big-response.png", "Big Response" %}

### Asynchronous SNI and balancing

This is a killer feature for any serious PaaS offering an HTTPS access to the
hosted applications. When enabled in configuration, on every incoming request
bud will do an http query to receive a TLS certificate/key pair and an address
of the backend to which this connection should be balanced.

See [docs][5] for details.

### Asynchronous OCSP stapling

The same kind of thing could be used to perform [OCSP stapling][15]
asynchronously, which is pretty useful if certificates are loaded dynamically
and it isn't possible to store all of them in memory.

See [docs][6] for more details.

All that asynchronous APIs are JSON based, so replying to such requests is as
easy as possible for almost any platform (including node.js).

### X-Forwarded-For

The latest feature that I have implemented so far is an `x-forward` backend
option. When enabled, bud will add `X-Forwarded-For` header to the first request
of all incoming HTTP connections and send custom `X_FORWARD` frame for all
[SPDY][16] connections.

This custom `X_FORWARD` frame is already supported in [node-spdy@1.25.0][11] and
will automatically add `X-Forwarded-For` header to all requests on that SPDY
connection.

The main pros of this method is that no actual protocol parsing is happening.
The cons is that, in case of HTTP protocol, only first request gets this header
added. This could be worked around by checking this header on incoming request
and associating it with a underlying socket (`req.socket` in node.js.)

## Try it out!

Hearing all that awesome things - you may become interested in giving it a try,
thanks to [npm][12] it is quite simple:

```sh
npm install -g bud-tls
```

Generating a configuration is easy too:

```sh
bud --default-config > config.json
vim config.json
```

All this options are documented in the [project's readme][13].

Just in case, this blog is running behind [bud][0]!
