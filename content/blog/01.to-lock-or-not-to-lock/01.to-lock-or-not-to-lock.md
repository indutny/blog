TL;DR
=====

As I've promised you in my [previous post][0], I made [TLSnappy][9] balance and
handle requests a little bit better.

Data flow
=========

For leveraging all available CPUs TLSnappy runs multiple threads that are each
picking and processing tasks from their dispatch queues, one by one. Tasks are
created from node's event-loop in following cases:

* Data comes from client and should be decrypted
* Data from server should be encrypted

So, as you can see, each thread is receiving data from it's inputs (either
`encrypted` or `clear`) and/or emitting data to it's outputs. This pattern
apparently requires a lot of data transfer `to` and `from` worker threads and
requires storing (buffering) that data in some temporary storage before
processing it.

To my mind, best structure to fit this needs is [Circular (Ring) buffer][5].
Because it's fast, can be grown if more than it's current capacity needs to be
held.

The [Naive version][4] of it was good enough to try out things, but it wasn't
supposed to be run in a multi-threaded concurrent environment - all access to
this buffer can take place only in a [critical section][7]. This means that at
any time only one thread may access the ring's methods or properties. You might
think that this doesn't make difference, but, according to [Amdahl's law][8],
reducing time spent in non-parallelizable (sequential) parts of application is
much more critical for overall performance than speeding up parallel parts.

Lock-less ring buffer
=====================

Removing locks seemed to be essential for achieving better performance, however
a special structure needs to be used in order to make a ring buffer work across
multiple CPUs. Here is the structure I chose for it:

{% image "./ring.png", "Ring buffer" %}

Ring consists of pages that're forming circular linked list, each page has two
offsets: reader (`roffset`) and writer (`woffset`). And there're two special
pages (which could be the same one actually): reader head (`rhead`) and writer
head (`whead`).

Initially the ring contains only one page which is `rhead` and `whead` at the
same time. When the producer wants to put data in - it goes to the `whead`,
copies data into the page, increments `woffset` and if the page is full - it
create a new page, or reuses an old one that doesn't contain any un-read data.
Consumer takes `rhead` reads up to `woffset - roffset` bytes from it, increments
`roffset` and moves to the next page if `roffset` is equal to the size of the
page.

So here are benchmarks:

Without lock-less ring:
```txt
Transactions:                 200000 hits
Availability:                 100.00 %
Elapsed time:                  47.90 secs
Data transferred:             585.37 MB
Response time:                  0.02 secs
Transaction rate:            4175.37 trans/sec
Throughput:                    12.22 MB/sec
Concurrency:                   98.79
Successful transactions:      200000
Failed transactions:               0
Longest transaction:            0.09
Shortest transaction:           0.00
```

With lock-less ring:

```txt
Transactions:                 200000 hits
Availability:                 100.00 %
Elapsed time:                  47.37 secs
Data transferred:             585.37 MB
Response time:                  0.02 secs
Transaction rate:            4222.08 trans/sec
Throughput:                    12.36 MB/sec
Concurrency:                   98.83
Successful transactions:      200000
Failed transactions:               0
Longest transaction:            0.12
Shortest transaction:           0.00
```

As you can see, performance hasn't greatly improved and is actually almost
beyond statistical error (which means that results are nearly the same). However
these are results for small 3kb page, lets try sending some big 100kb buffers.

```

Wow! That's much better - about 9% performance improvement.

Instruments
===========

Still TLSnappy's performance wasn't even close to what nginx is capable of
(~5100 requests per second). Thus it was necessary to continue investigation and
this is where [Instruments.app][10] comes into play, which is basically an UI for some
very useful dtrace scripts. I've run the `CPU Sampler` utility and this is what
the call tree looked like:
{% image "./original-node.png", "Original node" %}

Obviously it spends almost 30% of time in synchronization between threads,
particularly in `CRYPTO_add_lock` function:
{% image "./old-crypto-add-lock.png", "Old CRYPTO_add_lock" %}

After modifying the code to use atomic operations, which are supported by almost
every CPU nowadays):
{% image "./new-crypto-add-lock.png", "New CRYPTO_add_lock" %}

Call tree locked like this:
{% image "./patched-node.png", "Patched node" %}

Results
=======

I've opened [pull request for node.js][13] and sent the same patches to the
openssl-dev mailing list. With patched node and latest tlsnappy these are the
benchmark results:

{% image "./tlsnappy-rps-2.png", "Requests per second" %}
{% image "./tlsnappy-load-2.png", "Average load" %}

And that's without patches:

{% image "./tlsnappy-rps-siege.png", "Requests per second" %}
{% image "./tlsnappy-load-siege.png", "Average load" %}

A little comment about curve names here:

 * `default` - one tlsnappy process with 16 threads
 * `hybrid` - 4 tlsnappy processes with 4 threads each
 * `cluster` - 16 tlsnappy processes with 1 thread each
 * `http` - 16 node.js processes in cluster

The work is unfinished yet, but now I know that OpenSSL doesn't really behave
well when used in multithreaded application.
