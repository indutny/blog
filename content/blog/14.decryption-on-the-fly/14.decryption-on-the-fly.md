My team at Signal constantly faces challenges that go beyond what one would
expect while working on practically any other messaging application. Consider
the following facts about Signal:

- Does not collect telemetry.
- Uses [strong and proven cryptography][crypto] to enable end-to-end encryption
  by default while emphasizing security within the UX too.
- Doesn't permanently store queued end-to-end encrypted messages on the server,
  and thus is effectively a distributed application loosely coordinated by a
  centralized server.

It'd take a long time to discuss all of the implications of everything mentioned
above, and the [innumerable][pnp] [innovations][oram] that my colleagues have
created. In this post, however, we will concentrate on how attachments and other
user data are stored on the Signal Desktop client.

## Existing Code

Based on feedback from the community, we recently introduced an important change
to how dynamic resources are stored in Signal Desktop. Beginning in the
[Signal Desktop v7.18.0][release], attachments, avatars, stickers, and other
media are all individually encrypted on disk with the encryption key securely
stored in a local [SQLCipher][sqlcipher] database.

Given that Signal Desktop is an [Electron][electron] app, this presents a
challenge: How does one migrate existing references that point directly to
attachments on the file system (using tags like `<img/>`, `<video/>`, etc.)
and transition to a storage system where the displayed files can no longer
be loaded from disk without an explicit decryption step?

## Custom Protocol Handler

The breadth of the UI elements that would be affected by this change makes
loading and decrypting stored data within the React components _intractable_.
However, we identified a simpler path forward that leverages
[custom protocol handlers][protocol] in Electron. Because each stored
attachment is separately encrypted with a random key, the client
only needs to generate a simple formatted URL:

> `attachment://v2/ab/abcde?size=<num>&key=<base64>`

When Electron's main process receives a request with such a URL, it verifies the
supplied params and uses stream decryption to send back the decrypted attachment
via a Web API [`Response`][Response] object and Node's
[`Readable.toWeb()`][toWeb] helper. This means that the UI layer only has to be
modified at the stage where these URLs are generated, and individual components
can remain practically unchanged!

Naturally, there are some quirks about how Electron handles requests for
resources that support streaming (like video and audio files), and we had to
implement a [`Range` request][range] handler that only returns the requested
data chunks to the Renderer process instead of returning the whole file.

Originally, we created a Node.js stream for every request and then sliced the
desired data out of it with a simple 11-line [Transform][Transform] stream:

```js
let offset = 0;
const transform = new Transform({
  transform(data, _enc, callback) {
    if (offset + data.byteLength >= start && offset <= end) {
      this.push(data.subarray(Math.max(0, start - offset), end - offset));
    }

    offset += data.byteLength;
    callback();
  },
});
```

However, we quickly discovered that Chromium would issue a whopping 200 requests
for sufficiently large files instead of the small handful of requests that we
had seen for smaller files. This meant that the simple approach above wouldn't
scale but we also noticed that most of these requests were cancelled after only
reading a small amount of data, and their offsets were evenly distributed with
infrequent overlaps. Knowing this enabled us to write a more nuanced npm module
called ["range-finder"][rf].

{% image "./many-attachments.png", "Dev Tools Screenshot showing lots of requests" %}

In "range-finder," partially consumed streams are not immediately destroyed and
are reused for subsequent offset-based reads. Thus if Chromium requests a stream
starting from byte zero of the file, cancels it after 800kb, and then makes a
separate request for data starting from the 1-megabyte mark, then we can just
skip some data on the original stream and keep giving Chromium data without
opening and decrypting everything again from scratch.

This approach reduces the number of created streams from ~200 to ~3, which is an
improvement of more than 98%!

Here's the [source code][source] for the full protocol handler at the time of
writing this post.

In the future, we can move to a system where we don't have to decrypt the whole
file to get the desired chunk (which is usually around ~800kb in size), but more
on this later!

## Migration

The exciting story described above wouldn't be complete without also mentioning
the existing attachments that users who are updating from older versions of
Signal Desktop will still have on their computer. Since the on-disk size of the
data that needs to be migrated to the new storage format is potentially large,
and users can also close the app at any time, the migration and re-encryption
process can't block the app from launching or require everything to happen all
at once. Fortunately, as a result of past migrations, Signal Desktop already has
an existing system in place to migrate messages in smaller batches whenever the
app is idle on the user's computer. This system has now been updated to include
attachment re-encryption, and every file in the old format (v1) will be
migrated to the new format (v2) automatically.

You might have noticed that the attachment URL above had a `v2` in it.
Attachments that haven't been migrated yet also have their own special
URL format:

> `attachment://v1/ab/abcde`

Similarly, files at these URLs need to enable streaming to the UI with the
support of `Range` requests, and be able to handle all of the compatibility
updates for `v2` URLs too. Although every new attachment that is sent or
received on the latest version of Signal Desktop will start using the new v2
format right away, the versioned URL scheme helps keep things organized during
the short period of time where the UI has to display a mix of
v1 and v2 attachments during the migration process.
