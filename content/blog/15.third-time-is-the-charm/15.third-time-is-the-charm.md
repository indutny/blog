With the release of macOS Sequoia many developers must have started
discovering new exciting changes in otherwise settled and stable APIs.

One good example is Electron's [`desktopCapturer`][desktopCapturer] that lets apps list
windows and screens available for screensharing and then stream their contents
during a video call. With the Sequoia release, however, using `desktopCapturer`
directly presents [an extra window to popup][popup].

## Enter Pac-Man

Thankfully, Electron team was anticipating this API transition and has prepared
a [change][original patch] that lets macOS developers leverage the new APIs and
avoid the popup. After migrating the source code over, an unexpected oddity has
appeared in the testing. When sharing the screen for the first and the second
time screensharing the user would see the expected video:

{% image "./first-time.png", "Electron window with screensharing working correctly" %}

However, when attempting to share the third time, a happy green Pac-Man would
appear instead:

{% image "./third-time.png", "Electron window with screensharing with a Pac-Man" %}

Having no such test screen in the app's source code, the suspicion has landed at
this being either an Electron or Chromium issue.

## The Process

Just as with the most bugs, the fix consisted of three main steps:

- Reproduction
- Isolation
- Fix

### Reproduction

For Electron specifically, reproducing a bug in isolation is best done by
running code in [Electron Fiddle][fiddle]. Thankfully Electron's maintainers
already had a [gist][gist] prepared so the only work that had to be done was
clicking the "Start" button three times.

### Isolation

Isolation requires modifications outside of the test code and thus a full
Electron checkout. The best way to have it locally is to use
[official build tools][build-tools]. Roughly the following steps are needed:

```sh
npm i -g @electron/build-tools
e init --root=~/electron
e sync
e build
```

and then (after a few hours) `~/electron` will contain (among other things):

- Chromium repo at root
- Electron repo in `electron/` folder.

Given the [original patch][original patch], the first thing to check was
whether the execution gets into patched `ScreenCaptureKitDeviceMac::OnStart`
with the `use_native_picker` boolean set to `true`.

After adding a few C's "`console.log`" equivalents:

```c
fprintf(stderr, "we are here!\n");
```

and rebuilding with `e build`, it became apparent that the third "Start" click
doesn't get there at all.

Back-tracking from
`ScreenCaptureKitDeviceMac::OnStart` to farther farther callees, it
became clear that the issue is that Electron generates fake video source ids
that clash with Chromium's fake source id for the test green screen which has
a `DesktopMediaID::kFakeId = -3`.

The first "Start" click used `window:-1:0` as an id, the second -
`window:-2:0`, but when the id got to `window:-3:0` the check:

[`desktop_id.id == DesktopMediaID::kFakeId`][fake-id-check]

substituted the media stream with the test green screen.

### Fix

Now that the cause is known, the best solution appears to be to introduce an
another fake desktop id and set it to `-4`. This id would now be kept fixed, and
the second integer representing window id would be decremented for uniqueness
instead. After much waiting for builds and testing, the [final fix][fix] is just
69 lines long, and hopefully would prevent the clash of fake entities for good.

One never knows where an investigation might bring them, but thankfully this was
a short fun trip. Thank you for letting me take you along on it.
Until next time!
